About the Game
Hidden Dragon Chess II is a unique strategy game that combines the "fog of war" from our original Happy Flip Chess with the rich piece set of Chinese Chess (象棋). All 32 pieces, including the custom-made Archer, start face-down on a crowded 4x8 board. Players must balance the need to reveal powerful pieces with the risk of exposing them to capture, leading to a dynamic game of strategy, memory, and tactical skill.

How to Play
Object of the Game
The goal is to outmaneuver your opponent. The game ends when one player has no legal moves available. The winner is the player with the highest score, calculated from their pieces remaining on the board.

Game Setup
The Board: The game is played on a 4-row by 8-column grid (32 squares).

The Pieces: A full 32-piece Chinese Chess set is used, with one Soldier on each side replaced by an Archer.

Preparation: All 32 pieces are shuffled and placed randomly on each square, face-down.

Gameplay Flow
Starting Player: Players decide who goes first (Player 1) by any random method.

First Turn (Color Selection): Player 1 flips any hidden piece. The color of that piece (Red or Black) is assigned to Player 2. Player 1 gets the opposite color.

A Regular Turn: On your turn, you must perform one of two actions:

Flip: Choose any face-down piece to reveal it. This ends your turn.

Move: Choose one of your already revealed pieces and move or capture with it.

Custom Piece Rules
This variant uses custom movement rules for several pieces to create a unique experience.
