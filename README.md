Hidden Dragon Chess II: The Rise of the Archer
Official Rulebook
Object of the Game
To outmaneuver your opponent on a mysterious battlefield. The goal is to strategically reveal your army, capture enemy pieces, and end the game with a higher score based on your remaining forces.

1. Game Setup
1.1. The Board: The game is played on a 4 row by 8 column grid (32 squares).

1.2. The Pieces: The game uses a full, 32-piece set of Chinese Chess (象棋) pieces, including the custom Archer piece.

1.3. Preparation: All 32 pieces are shuffled and placed randomly on each of the 32 squares, face-down. At the start, the board is completely full, and the identity of each piece is hidden.

2. How to Play
2.1. Starting Player (Player 1): The two players first decide who will begin. This can be done by any random method (flipping a coin, etc.).

2.2. The First Turn (Color Selection):

Player 1 begins by choosing any single face-down piece on the board and flipping it face-up.

The color of this revealed piece (Red or Black) is assigned to Player 2.

Player 1 is assigned the opposite color for the rest of the game.

Player 1's turn is now over. The turn passes to Player 2, who will make the first strategic move.

2.3. A Regular Turn:
On your turn, you must perform one of two possible actions:

Flip: Choose any face-down piece on the board and reveal it. This ends your turn.

Move: Choose one of your already revealed pieces and move it according to its unique rules. This may include capturing an opponent's piece.

3. Piece Movement & Capture Rules
Pieces can only move to an empty square or to a square occupied by an opponent's revealed piece. You cannot capture hidden pieces.

General (帥/將): Moves and captures one square in any of the 8 directions (straight or diagonal), like a standard Chess King.

Advisor (士/仕): A versatile defender.

Move: Can move one square in any of the 8 directions to an empty square.

Capture: Can only capture an opponent's piece on the 4 diagonal squares.

Elephant (象/相): Moves and captures any number of squares diagonally, just like a standard Chess Bishop. It must stop at the first piece it encounters.

Horse (馬/傌): Moves and captures in an 'L' shape, just like a standard Chess Knight. It can jump over any other pieces, hidden or revealed.

Chariot (車/俥): Moves and captures any number of squares in a straight line (orthogonally), just like a standard Chess Rook. It must stop at the first piece it encounters.

Cannon (炮/砲): A unique long-range attacker.

Move: Moves like a Chariot but must stop at the first piece it encounters (hidden or revealed). It cannot jump when only moving.

Capture: To capture, the Cannon must jump over exactly one piece (friend or foe, hidden or revealed), called a "screen," and land on an opponent's revealed piece behind it.

Soldier (卒/兵): Moves and captures one square in any of the four orthogonal directions (forward, backward, left, or right).

Archer (弩/弓): A new long-range sniper.

Move: Moves one square orthogonally (forward, backward, left, or right) to an empty square.

Capture: "Shoots" to capture an opponent's piece that is exactly two squares away in any of the 8 directions. It ignores the piece in the middle square.

4. Ending the Game & Winning
The game ends immediately when the player whose turn it is has no legal actions available. This occurs when:

The player has no revealed pieces they can legally move.

AND there are no hidden pieces left on the board for them to flip.

As soon as the game ends, the scores of all pieces remaining on the board are tallied. The player with the higher score wins.
